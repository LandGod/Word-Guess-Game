# Word Guess Game
Word Guess Game aka **Super Realistic Hacking Simulator** is a game in which the user guesses a word. In other words, it's hangman. The rules should be familiar to anyone who has played hangman before.

* A word (the answer) is picked by the computer that the user must then try to guess.
* The user must guess one letter at a time.
* The user has a set number of wrong guesses which they are allowed before they lose the game.
* If the letter appears in the answer any number of times, the the guess is considered 'correct' and all instances of the letter in the word are filled in.
* If the same letter is guessed more than once, it is not counted as an incorrect guess after the first time.
* The user wins by correctly guessing every letter of the answer without having too many wrong guesses.

For this game, I've gone with an 80s retro futurism aesthetic. A certain amount of tongue-in-cheek humor has also been attempted in deference to the long history of laughably inaccurate portrayals of hacking in popular culture.
